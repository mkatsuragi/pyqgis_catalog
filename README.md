# pyqgis_catalog
A code "cookbook" with common tasks using PyQgis.

# How to use this repository
Welcome to yet another PyQgis cookbook. This repository contains some useful PyQGIS routines I used to learn the basic concepts of this particular tool.

One may think that the sctructure used in this repository is not the ideal one for a production GIS and he/she is absolutely right. The idea here is to present a small *script*, like a recipe and discuss what is going on. In fact, I based this type of presentation on tutorials like Zed Shaw's "Learn Python The Hard Way".

Once you understand what is used you may develope your own module or add useful things to your already existing library. For every code, there is Markdown file explaining what is going on and some few other useful information so you can improve the code to something you are going to use. 

# Directories

There are some directories created within this repository. Make sure you know where things are:

**scripts:** where all .py files are. For each python file there is a .md containing a short "lesson" for those interested on learning PyQgis.

**scripts/data:** for the cookbook I used a Open Street Map extraction provided by GeoFrabik and based on the OSM Contributors with a distinct license. Therefore be mindful that, even this code is provided under GPLv3, the same DO NOT apply to OSM data. Please, refer to scripts/data/README for credits and further information.
